# AntColonyOptimization
The Ant colony optimization is a metaheuristic technique based on swarm intel-
ligence for solving combinatorial optimization problems developed by Marco Dorigo
and his co-researchers at the beginning of the 1990â€™s which is inspired upon stigmergic
communication to find out the shortest path. The ant colony algorithm is an algorithm
for finding optimal paths that is based on the behavior of ants searching for food which
is away from anthill. At first, the ants wander randomly. When an ant finds a source
of food, it walks back to the colony leaving a chemical substance on the way called
pheromone that shows the path has food. The pheromones that are laid to and fro to-
wards the food source is called as pheromone trail. It is very useful to find out the
direction of the food source. When other ants come across the pheromone trail, they
are likely to follow the path with a certain probability. If they do, then populate the
path with their own pheromones.As more ants find the path, it gets stronger pheromone
concentrations. Because the ants secreted pheromones every time they brought food.
They choose the shortest path from many paths by using a pheromone trail which can
be conveniently seen in the terms of a collective learning process happening over time.
Shorter paths are more likely to be stronger, hence optimizing the solution.
